Sample Java Code used for Studying about JAVA SE 8

This project is a bunch of java classes with a public static void main used for getting hands on in specfic aspects of Java SE.

I wrote this bunch of code for learning aim and studying for a Java certification.
 
Although there isn't expert code here and classes with comments explaining what is going on, I think this code might be helpful to make you think and understand about some very interesting aspects of Java SE.

(Generics, Stream, Collections, ForkJoin Framework and etc)

Have fun! :)
