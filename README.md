Sample Java Code used for Studying about JAVA SE 8

This project is a bunch of java classes with a public static void main used for getting hands on in specfic aspects of Java SE.

I wrote this bunch of code for learning aim and studying for a Java certification.
 
Do not expect expert code here and classes with comments explaining what is going on.
Some of classes does not even compile.
