# java_se8_hands_on_code
Sample Java Code used for Study about JAVA SE 8

This project is a bunch of java classes with a public static void main used for getting hands on in specfic aspects of Java SE 
(and see what happens if I change code here or there..., so, getting away expert doubts, fool doubts, or/and just for remebering 
some rules of Java SE API), specifically, version 8.

Do not expect expert code here and classes with comments explaining what is going on.
Some of classes does not even compile.

I write this bunch of code to learning goal and studying for a Java certification.
